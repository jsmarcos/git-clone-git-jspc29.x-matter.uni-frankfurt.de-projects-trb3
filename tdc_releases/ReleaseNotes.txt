Version		Release Date	Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tdc_v2.0	15.11.2012	Double edge detection for longer than 20 ns is
				implemented. (Not stable-will be fixed in
				future releases.)

tdc_v1.7.1	29.07.2014	Feature Bit support.
				Tidy up the entities.

tdc_v1.7	24.06.2014	Paralel working Readouts are implemented.
				Trigger time calculation is done in the
				trigger handler.
	
tdc_v1.6.3	24.06.2014	Bug fix in the hit rate counters
				(syncronisation problem).

tdc_v1.6.2	08.05.2014	Small bug fix in the wait time for data
				transfer to buffer.

tdc_v1.6.1	06.05.2014	Less EPOCH counter - unnecessary EPOCH words,
				which occur with enabled trigger window, are
				eliminated from the data stream.
				FSM initialisation problem by the Channel_200
				entity is solved.
				Channel FSM debug words are written to bus
				0xc200.
				Number of coarse counters is increased to 16
				to ease the fanout.
				Bug fix for the missing data with the
				calibration trigger.
				Bug fix for the duplicate data when trigger
				window is enabled.

tdc_v1.6	20.01.2014	Epoch counter bug fix (data word - epoch word
				place swap).
				Trigger window bug fix (epoch counter more
				than 24 bit had integer conversion
				problem. Trigger window right side control is
				enabled).
				Readout algorith change (the channel fifos are
				readout to intermediate buffer, so the later
				channels in the readout order are kept as the
				trigger arrival time).
				Trigger on TDC channel (the feature for
				triggering on TDC channel is implemented)
				Reference channel hit rate counter
				implemented.
				The channels (incl. ch0) can be calibrated
				with the internal oscillator with different
				frequencies (see manual slow control
				registers).
				The coarse counter can be set to reset via
				slow control. The action will take place when
				the first valid trigger arrives.

tdc_v1.5.1	20.06.2013	Efficiency bug fix (epoch counter update - hit
				at the same time). Hit level bit bug fix for
				the web server. Reference Channel coarse
				counter alignmet fix.

tdc_v1.5	03.05.2013	TDC calibration trigger is implemented in
				order to shoot every channel with sufficient #
				of hits for proper calibration. Also the TDC
				is adapted for short pulses.

tdc_v1.4	18.04.2013	Limiting data transfer functionality is
				added. Use 0xc804 register to define the # of
				word per channel to be read-out.

tdc_v1.3	05.03.2013	Encoder efficiency is increased to 100%. Extra
				bits are encoded in the data (low resolution
				and no successfull binary conversion, see the
				manual).
				Channel block during the readout is
				removed. Only the relevant hits per trigger
				are readout.
				Control registers are moved to 0xc800.

tdc_v1.2	12.11.2012	First strecher prototype is successfully
				implemented. Some bugs are fixed. 

tdc_v1.1.1	07.11.2012	The status registers are moved to the bus
				address 0xc100. Also debug registers (encoder
				start, fifo write, lost hits) are included in
				the bus - 0xc200 0xc300 0xc400

tdc_v1.1	26.10.2012	Readout process is collected in an individual entity.

tdc_v1.0	25.10.2012	The time measurement interval is extended with
				a 28-bit epoch counter.

tdc_v0.5	22.10.2012	Hit counter registers and LVDS receiver output
				level can be reached via slow control.
