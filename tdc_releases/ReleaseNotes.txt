Version		Release Date	Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tdc_v2.0	15.11.2012	Double edge detection for longer than 20 ns is
				implemented. (Not stable-will be fixed in
				future releases.)

tdc_v1.5	03.05.2013	TDC calibration trigger is implemented in
				order to shoot every channel with sufficient #
				of hits for proper calibration. Also the TDC
				is adapted for short pulses.

tdc_v1.4	18.04.2013	Limiting data transfer functionality is
				added. Use 0xc804 register to define the # of
				word per channel to be read-out.

tdc_v1.3	05.03.2013	Encoder efficiency is increased to 100%. Extra
				bits are encoded in the data (low resolution
				and no successfull binary conversion, see the
				manual).
				Channel block during the readout is
				removed. Only the relevant hits per trigger
				are readout.
				Control registers are moved to 0xc800.

tdc_v1.2	12.11.2012	First strecher prototype is successfully
				implemented. Some bugs are fixed. 

tdc_v1.1.1	07.11.2012	The status registers are moved to the bus
				address 0xc100. Also debug registers (encoder
				start, fifo write, lost hits) are included in
				the bus - 0xc200 0xc300 0xc400

tdc_v1.1	26.10.2012	Readout process is collected in an individual entity.

tdc_v1.0	25.10.2012	The time measurement interval is extended with
				a 28-bit epoch counter.

tdc_v0.5	22.10.2012	Hit counter registers and LVDS receiver output
				level can be reached via slow control.
