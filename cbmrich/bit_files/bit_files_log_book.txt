cbmrich_20120626.bit	31 channels with 32x512 FIFO. caused problems with the
			readout, because the size of the tdc bufers are too
			big for the endpoint buffers.

cbmrich_20120705.bit	31 channels. Tdc channel buffer size is decreased to
			32x32. During tests at gsi lab there were no
			problems with old hades DAQ setup
			(scntr+hub+cts). Later with trb3 hub the daq hangs
			after few triggers.

cbmrich_20120721.bit	2 channels. Recompiled to test the previous
			problem. The DAQ runs just fine. But there is no data
			from the reference channel. TDL line is somehow corrupt.

cbmrich_20120725.bit	31 channels. Went back to the version 0.2 in order to
			get rid of the problem with the TDL. PAR successful
			but has to be tested (26.07.2012)

cbmrich_20120802.bit	31 channels in order to test the missing events from
			the reference channel.

cbmrich_20120810.bit	32 channels.

cbmrich_20120813.bit	65 channels. Channel 28, spi_dac and a debug signal in
			endpoint don't meet the timing constraints.

cbrich_20120903.bit	65 channels without any timing problems. Also some
			bugs are fixed with the coarse counter.

cbmrich_20121009.bit	4 channels test design with the new epoch counter and
			scaler counter.
